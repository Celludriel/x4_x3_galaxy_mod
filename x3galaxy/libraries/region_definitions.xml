  The following definitions can be referenced by their name in region macros in the map, but if you follow a naming scheme the game will also dynamically place regions.
  If you use the name "globalregion_<cluster_macro_name>", a region will be placed in the middle of the cluster.
  If you use the name "globalregion_<sector_macro_name>", a region will be placed in the middle of the sector.
  If you define a cluster-wide region it's recommended to omit the <boundary> node, making the region effectively infinite in size.
  If you define a sector-wide region it's recommended to use this boundary:
    <boundary class="sphere">
      <size r="1000000" />
    </boundary>
  This should be large enough for practical purposes, but not overlap any other sectors in the same cluster.
